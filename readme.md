    This project serves as an Ultimate reference guide for all chefs

## Setup
    The app has all the required files and libraries in it in 
    the form of links.

    Open index.html in your browser.opening anyother file in
    browser will not work because some javscript files is used to store
    data in the browser localStorage which is required by other html files
